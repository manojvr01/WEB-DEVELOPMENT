    <h1>Nuclear weapon</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p><i><b>"Atom bomb", "A-bomb", and "Nuke" redirect here. For other uses, see Atom bomb (disambiguation), A-bomb
                (disambiguation), and Nuke (disambiguation).</b></i></p>
    <p>A nuclear weapon[a] is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either
        <b>nuclear fission </b><del>(fission or atomic bomb) </del>or a combination of fission and nuclear fusion
        reactions(thermonuclear weapon[b]), producing a nuclear explosion. Both bomb types release large quantities of
        energy from relatively small amounts of matter
    </p>
    <P>Nuclear weapons have had yields between 10 tons (the W54) and 50 megatons for the Tsar Bomba (see TNT
        equivalent). <mark>Yields in the low kilotons can devastate cities. A thermonuclear weapon weighing as little as
            600
            pounds (270 kg) can release energy equal to more than 1.2 megatons of TNT (5.0 PJ)</mark>.[1] Apart from the
        blast,
        effects of nuclear weapons include extreme heat and ionizing radiation, firestorms, radioactive nuclear fallout,
        an electromagnetic pulse, and a radar blackout
        The first nuclear weapons were developed by the United States in collaboration with the United Kingdom and
        Canada during World War II in the Manhattan Project. Production requires a large scientific and industrial</P>
    <p>Complex, primarily for the production of fissile material, either from nuclear reactors with reprocessing plants
        or from uranium enrichment facilities. Nuclear weapons have been used twice in war, in the 1945 atomic bombings
        of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that killed between 150,000 and 246,000 people. Nuclear deterrence, including mutually
        assured destruction, aims to prevent nuclear warfare via the threat of unacceptable damage and the danger of
        escalation to nuclear holocaust. A nuclear arms race for weapons and their delivery systems was a defining
        component of the Cold War.<br>

        Strategic nuclear weapons are <u>targeted against civilian, industrial, and military infrastructure, while
            tactical</u>
        nuclear weapons are intended for battlefield use. Strategic weapons led to the development of dedicated
        intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missile, and nuclear strategic bombers,
        collectively known as the nuclear triad. Tactical weapons options have included shorter-range ground-, air-, and
        sea-launched missiles, nuclear artillery, atomic demolition munitions, nuclear torpedoes, and nuclear depth
        charges, but they have become less salient since the end of the Cold War
        As of 2025, there are nine countries on the list of states with nuclear weapons, and six more agree to nuclear
        sharing. Roughly 40 countries have defense policies linked to nuclear armament, through NATO membership or
        agreements with other nuclear powers.[2] Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction, and their control is a
        focus of international security through measures to prevent nuclear proliferation, arms control, or nuclear
        disarmament. The total from all stockpiles peaked at over 64,000 weapons in 1986,[3] and is around 9,600
        today.[4] Key international agreements and organizations include the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
        Weapons, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, the
        International Atomic Energy Agency, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and nuclear-weapon-free
        zones.
